## SSN/SOSA

SSN [https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/] is an ontology for describing sensors, their observations, and the procedures involved, as well as the features and properties they measure. It includes SOSA, a lightweight core ontology that defines key elements such as sensors, observations, samples, and actuators. Together, SSN and SOSA are widely used for applications like satellite imagery and large-scale scientific monitoring.
