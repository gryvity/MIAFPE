# Ontology and Controlled Vocabulary

## Introduction (WIP)

When we talk about things, misunderstandings and ambiguities can arise. A particular message may contain terms that are understood differently by different recipients. While some words have the same spelling regardless of their pronunciation (homographs) or the same pronunciation regardless of their spelling (homophones) but have different meanings, a factor that changes the interpretation of words may be due to the social, cultural, regional, educational, or subject-specific background of the recipients.

Imagine a message shared within an interdisciplinary team of scientists working on a climate change project. The message states: "The model predicts a significant increase in temperature over the next decade." To a climatologist, the term "model" might refer to a complex climate simulation. However, to a data scientist, "model" might suggest a statistical or machine learning model, while to an engineer, it might evoke a physical or conceptual model of a system. These different interpretations of the term "model" could lead to confusion about what exactly is being predicted and how the predictions were generated.

To help colleagues from different domains transfer the knowledge represented by the message with great accuracy, it is best to have a set of agreed-on and available definitions of the terms used in the message.

A Controlled Vocabulary play a crucial role in achieving this clarity. By providing a standardized set of terms and definitions, they ensure that everyone on the team, regardless of their background or field of expertise, interprets the message in the same way. This reduces the risk of misunderstandings and enhances the ability to collaborate effectively across disciplines. Ontologies go a step further by not only defining terms but also establishing the relationships between them, enabling a richer and more precise representation of knowledge.

In scientific research, where precision and consistency are paramount, these tools are indispensable. They allow researchers to share data and insights with confidence, knowing that their work will be understood correctly by others, whether they're in the same field or in a completely different domain. By eliminating ambiguities and standardizing terminology, controlled vocabularies and ontologies make it possible to integrate and build upon knowledge in ways that are essential for advancing science.




# Ontology

An Ontology defines types that exist and their interrelations. While **Knowledge Bases** generally integrate both **definitional** and **assertional** knowledge, ontologies focus only on definitional knowledge (what is always true of entities).

The development of ontologies is guided by fundamental ontological distinctions and supported by formalisms and tools for knowledge **representation**.

Ontological Distinctions:
- Instance vs Type: While an type describes the conceptual fundament (a class consisting of a collection attributes (these might be of certain types as well) and methodes)
