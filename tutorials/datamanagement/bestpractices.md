## Introduction

### Motivation
In the rapidly advancing field of plant phenotyping, data generation has increased exponentially in both volume and complexity. This growth is fueled by high-throughput phenotyping technologies, diverse sensor types, and advanced data collection platforms, including UAVs, satellites, and other remote sensing devices​(161547v1.full)​(fpls-12-749374). Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also driving new possibilities, enhancing the insights derived from these data but also introducing additional complexities in data handling, storage, and reproducibility​(paper8)​(s41597-023-02364-z). In this landscape, effective data stewardship has become essential, ensuring that valuable datasets remain accessible, reusable, and beneficial for advancing agricultural science.

Despite these technological advancements, a significant "phenotyping bottleneck" remains. While genetic data generation and sharing have become increasingly streamlined, translating these insights into functional plant traits under real-world conditions is hindered by inconsistencies in data quality, structure, and metadata. Researchers are frequently required to engage in "data archaeology"—an exhaustive process of reconstructing datasets that lack standardization, which severely hampers data integration and reuse​(533452a)​(s41597-022-01815-3).

The FAIR principles—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—provide a structured framework for enhancing data sharing, documentation, and compatibility across studies. Metadata standards like MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) are critical in this context, guiding researchers to produce metadata-rich datasets that facilitate interoperability and reusability across disciplines​(Guidelines-for-Handling…). MIAPPE’s implementation underscores the necessity of metadata in making data FAIR-compliant, supporting easier data discovery, integration, and reuse, which are vital for efficient scientific progress and the cumulative knowledge-building essential for sustainable agriculture​(sdata201618).

Yet, current practices in scientific data sharing often lack universal adoption of FAIR principles, as many researchers do not view data publication with the same recognition as traditional publications. Consequently, datasets frequently lack sufficient metadata or consistent formatting, limiting their utility for others. This lack of robust data-sharing practices not only reduces the individual value of datasets but also constrains broader scientific advancements​(fpls-12-749374). As funding bodies and journals increasingly require FAIR data-sharing practices, establishing workflows and guidelines aligned with these mandates is essential. This guide aims to provide the plant phenotyping community with best practices across the entire data lifecycle—from planning to publication. By embedding FAIR principles into research practices, researchers can maximize the longevity, impact, and scientific contribution of their data, ultimately advancing sustainable agriculture and global food security.

### Field Phenotyping Data
Field phenotyping data are critical for understanding the intricate interactions between plant genetics and environmental factors under real-world conditions. These data enable researchers to assess traits such as drought tolerance, disease resistance, and yield stability, providing insights essential for crop improvement and adaptation to environmental challenges​(159766919). Unlike controlled experiments, field phenotyping exposes plants to natural environmental variability, making it invaluable for breeding programs targeting resilience and sustainable agriculture​(533452a).

The data collected in field phenotyping studies are diverse, covering morphological and physiological traits as well as environmental variables like soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity. As technology has advanced, so too has the scale of data collection: high-throughput systems now integrate sensors, drones, and satellite imagery, generating large, complex datasets that require robust data management practices​(161547v1.full). These datasets are indispensable for developing resilient crop varieties and addressing global agricultural challenges, but their inherent complexity often creates challenges for integration and reuse across studies​(paper8).

One of the primary obstacles in leveraging field phenotyping data is the lack of standardization. Data are generated in diverse environments, by different researchers, and with varied methodologies, often without consistent metadata and structure, which complicates data sharing and analysis​(s41597-023-02364-z). Consequently, many datasets remain isolated within individual studies, impeding broader scientific progress and limiting the potential for meta-analyses that can offer deeper insights across environments and crop types.

To address these challenges, the FAIR principles and standards like MIAPPE have become increasingly relevant. By providing clear guidelines for data and metadata documentation, these frameworks enable datasets to be more readily discoverable, accessible, and interoperable, ensuring that data generated in field phenotyping can be reused and integrated into larger analyses​(Guidelines-for-Handling…). As field phenotyping continues to expand its role in agriculture, adhering to these standards will be crucial for building an open and sustainable data ecosystem that supports global food security and agricultural resilience​(sdata201618).

## Data Life Cycle


In scientific research, managing data effectively across its entire life cycle is essential for maximizing its impact, usability, and longevity. The data life cycle represents a structured approach to organizing data from the initial planning stages through collection, processing, analysis, preservation, sharing, and eventual reuse. Each stage involves specific actions and decisions that affect data quality, accessibility, and long-term value, particularly in high-throughput and heterogeneous domains like field phenotyping, where data complexity is high and cross-study compatibility is vital.

Understanding and implementing best practices across these stages enables researchers to adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, thereby enhancing the utility of their data for a broader scientific community. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless flow that facilitates not only immediate research objectives but also future data integration, meta-analysis, and long-term accessibility.

### Motivation
In today’s rapidly advancing fields of plant phenotyping and scientific research, the challenge of properly managing data is paramount to enhance reproducibility, accessibility, and utility. Effective data management becomes crucial in addressing the “phenotyping bottleneck” that exists between genomics and breeding, which significantly impacts crop production and resilience under changing environmental conditions​(159766919). Despite advances in phenotyping technology, data complexity and inconsistent documentation still hinder data reuse and meta-analysis, as seen in plant phenotyping studies where varied experimental settings and heterogeneity complicate data integration​(s41597-023-02364-z).

The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) are essential in fostering data integration and reuse, aiming to reduce the resource-intensive “data archaeology” currently required to reconstruct datasets without standardized metadata​(s41597-023-02364-z). Metadata standards, such as MIAPPE, enable researchers to document critical experimental details effectively, making data not only reusable but also more readily understandable across disciplines​(s41597-022-01815-3). As funding bodies and scientific communities increasingly mandate FAIR-compliant data, establishing robust metadata templates and workflows becomes central to ensuring that datasets retain value beyond their initial use and contribute to broader scientific and societal goals​(s41597-022-01815-3).

### Good Practice Guideline for Publishing Data in Field Phenotyping

Publishing data is a vital step in making your research accessible, reusable, and visible to the broader scientific community. Proper data management not only ensures that your work is recognized, but it also allows others to build upon it, increasing its impact. Follow this comprehensive guide to ensure that your data is structured, understandable, and prepared for long-term accessibility.

#### 1. Understand the Benefits of Publishing Your Data
   Publishing data brings measurable benefits to both you and the scientific community:
   - **Visibility**: Your experiments gain recognition, and others can see the valuable work you’ve contributed.
   - **Collaboration**: Others may utilize your data to ask new scientific questions or analyze it from different perspectives using new methodologies.
   - **Contribution**: Your data becomes part of a larger body of work, advancing scientific knowledge and innovation.

#### 2. Ensure Human-Readable and Machine-Readable Formats
   Data should be easily interpreted by both humans and machines. This dual accessibility makes your data more versatile for different uses, from visual analysis to computational tasks. Here are key considerations:
   - **Human-Readable**: Attach clear, meaningful metadata and descriptions to provide context.
   - **Machine-Readable**: Use structured formats (such as CSV, JSON, XML) that machines can parse efficiently, ensuring reusability in automated systems.

#### 3. Structure Your Data Meaningfully
   A well-structured dataset is essential for ease of access and reuse:
   - **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize your files into folders and subfolders that represent logical relationships (e.g., by experiment, date, sensor type).
   - **Relational Data**: If your data refers to external databases or APIs, provide clear instructions on how to retrieve the external data, including API endpoints or query examples.
   - **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive file names that include key information (e.g., experiment name, date, sensor type). For example, **“WheatPhenotype_June2022_LiDAR.hdr”** is far more informative than **“test01.hdr”**.

#### 4. Label Variables Clearly
   - When working with tabular data, ensure that all variables are named descriptively in column headers. For example, use **“Leaf_Area_Index”** instead of **“LAI”** if the acronym is not widely recognized.
   - Include units for numerical data where applicable (e.g., **Height_cm**, **Temperature_C**).

#### 5. Describe Data Processing and Decisions
   - **Document Processing Steps**: During data processing, you likely made decisions (e.g., how to handle missing data). These should be documented in detail. If missing values are represented by **“-99”** or **“NA”**, make sure this is clear to the end user.
   - **Data Provenance**: Keep track of the history of your data from raw files to polished datasets. This transparency helps future users understand how the data was transformed.

#### 6. Attach Comprehensive Metadata
   Metadata is critical for understanding the context of your data:
   - **Choose a Metadata Standard**: Depending on the domain, there are many standards available (e.g., MIAPPE for plant phenotyping, Dublin Core for general datasets). These standards guide you in describing important aspects like:
     - Experiment details.
     - Variables measured.
     - Sensors or equipment used.
   - **Metadata File**: Create a separate metadata file (e.g., in XML or JSON-LD format) that can be attached to your dataset. The metadata should describe the dataset structure, key variables, and methodology.

#### 7. Avoid Proprietary File Formats
   - **File Formats**: Use widely accepted, open formats whenever possible. Proprietary formats can be a barrier to reuse, as not everyone has access to licensed software.
     - For instance, prefer **CSV** or **JSON** over formats like **Excel (.xls)** or **MATLAB (.mat)** for tabular data.
   - **Document Software and Tools**: If specialized software was used, provide clear details, including the name, version, settings, and license. This ensures that others can reproduce or understand your processing pipeline.

#### 8. Openly Communicate About Your Data
   - **Engage with the Community**: Reach out to peers, collaborators, or data experts to discuss your data. They may provide insights on how to improve its structure, clarity, or relevance.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Sharing your datasets can lead to constructive feedback and discussions, improving the quality and usability of your data over time.

#### 9. Ethical Considerations and Data Licensing
   - **Data Ethics**: Ensure that your data does not violate ethical standards, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
   - **Data Licensing**: Choose an appropriate license for your data that specifies how others can use it. Open licenses such as **Creative Commons (CC BY)** or **Open Data Commons** are common choices, depending on your sharing goals.

#### 10. Plan for Long-Term Data Stewardship
   - **Repository Selection**: Choose a suitable data repository for publishing your data. Examples include **Zenodo**, **Figshare**, or domain-specific repositories like **Plant Phenotyping Repository**.
   - **DOIs and Citation**: Request a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for your dataset. This provides a permanent link for others to cite your data, contributing to academic recognition.
