doi:10.26165/JUELICH-DATA/QJIY7C,"Experimental data: Field Phenotyping of Ten Wheat Cultivars under Elevated CO2 Shows Seasonal Differences in Chlorophyll Fluorescence, Plant Height and Vegetation Indices","Experiment is part of the ""Big baking"" project. Higher CO2 concentrations change the growth dynamics of the C3 plant wheat. Higher yields are accompanied by lower protein contents. Field trials under an atmosphere with increased CO2 levels (FACE experiments) are intended to depict future scenarios and show the effect on the protein composition and baking quality of wheat. Previous breeding objectives may have to be reconsidered. The experimental data consist of the LIFT, PhenoCam, UAV, yield and environmental data.
