<h1>Minimum Information About Field Phenotyping Experiments</h1> 
<h2>SUBTITLE</h2>



## Introduction

This project aims to build upon the minimal information appoach to create a standardized and user-friendly template for documenting field phenotyping experiments. For plant phenotyping experiments in general such a standard is realized in MIAPPE (Minimum Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiments) [[1]](references.md#material/erv271.pdf). MAIPPE basically offers a checklist with experiment properties that the researcher should document to provide a minimal yet sufficient description of the experiment, enabling -- in the best case scenario -- reproducibility of the experiment and enhance the potential for data reuse, for example for meta-analysis studies or for training machine learning models. Its structure is insprired by the ISA model, which introduces Investigation, Study and Assay as core entities to structure experiment metadata organized in a graph structure, linking the different entities together.
