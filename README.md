This project aims to build upon the minimal information appoach to create a standardized and user-friendly template for documenting field phenotyping experiments. For plant phenotyping experiments in general such a standard is realized in MIAPPE (Minimum Information About Plant Phenotyping Experiments) [[1]](references.md#material/erv271.pdf). MAIPPE basically offers a checklist with experiment properties that the researcher should document to provide a minimal yet sufficient description of the experiment, enabling -- in the best case scenario -- reproducibility of the experiment and enhance the potential for data reuse, for example for meta-analysis studies or for training machine learning models. Its structure is insprired by the ISA model, which introduces Investigation, Study and Assay as core entities to structure experiment metadata organized in a graph structure, linking the different entities together.


### Ontology

"An ontology is usually defined as 'a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization' (Gruber 1995)" providing a non-ambiguous and formal representation of a domain.
Here, 'explicit' means that all concepts and relations are explicitly formalized and 'shared' means that the ontology represents consensual knowledge accepted by a community of users. 'Conceptualization' refers to an abstract model of some phenomenon in the world by identifying the relevant concepts of that phenomenon. Formal ontologies are based on description logics, a decidable fragment of first-order logic, which allows for reasoning and inference over the represented knowledge. Ontologies are used in various domains, including artificial intelligence, semantic web, biomedical informatics, and information science, to facilitate knowledge sharing, data integration, and interoperability among systems.
