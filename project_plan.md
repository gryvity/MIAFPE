# Project Plan
## Minimal Information about Field Phenotyping Experiments

### Tasks for this week (dec 3rd '25)

- Create detailed Project plan for the publication
- gather material
- contact people involved and inform about my plan
- Reshape Excel (without examples)
- Revisit datasets which used the prototyped miafpe tables


## IMPORTANT
Objectives (immediate goals):

1. Transform MIAPPE into a more usable format (RDF/JSON/XML/CSV)
2. Extend MIAPPE with SOSA/SSN ontology in a modular way
3. Pick two case investigations to demonstrate the use of MIAPPE Sensor extension and the transformed formats


## MIAFPE Elements



- Create Complete Data Map
- Take Datasets from Julie and Sofie as examples for Field Experiments
- (Create ARC Templates)
- Create Access Point for mew Ontologies (discover a set of useful domain-relevant ontologies)
- Work on KnowledgeBase -> Here I will also collect material for the publication






Future Goals (long-term):

- FORK MIAPPE
- include data model (protege)
- include MIAPPE examples
- Think about connection to BrAPI and ARC
- Transformer Tools

Too-Kit (idea section)
- MIAPPE Validator: gives feedback on MIAPPE compliance
- MIAPPE autocompleter: suggests values based on previous entries
- MIAPPE designer: tool to help researchers fill in MIAPPE metadata
- MAIPPE to RDF converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to RDF format
- MIAPPE to JSON converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to JSON format
- MIAPPE to XML converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to XML format
- MIAPPE to CSV converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to CSV format
- MIAPPE to BrAPI converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to BrAPI format
- MIAPPE to ARC converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to ARC format
- MIAPPE to ISA converter: converts MIAPPE metadata to ISA format
- MIAPPE Transformer: a tool for transforming a MIAPPE file into a vector representation capable of measuring similarities between datasets
- Geo Scraper: a tool for gathering geoinformation within a dataset
- MIAPPE Visualizer: a tool for visualizing MIAPPE metadata in a user-friendly way
- MIAPPE API: a RESTful API for accessing MIAPPE metadata and tools
- nice tool for gathering datafiles

Study Case (suggestions)
- Harvesting metadata from dataset in order to find similarities within different datasets (temporal, spatial, contextual)
